# Cart-Pole-Control
A repository which tests various Reinforcement Learning algorithms to control the Cart Pole with inverted pendulum. The environment is from OpenAI Gymnasium. This repository was created when I started learning the practical implementation of reinforcement learning. 

## Current Implementation
- **Decision Transformer** - Offline RL approach that treats RL as a sequence modelling problem
  - Implemented with PyTorch
  - Includes training and evaluation scripts
  - Pre-trained models available in `/models`
