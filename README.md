# Cart-Pole-Control
A repository which tests various Reinforcement Learning algorithms to control the Cart Pole with inverted pendulum. The environment is from OpenAI Gymnasium. This repository was created when I started learning the practical implementation of reinforcement learning.

(This is the video output file from one of the control done by Decision Transformer )

## Current Implementation
- **Decision Transformer** - Offline RL approach that treats RL as a sequence modelling problem
  - Implemented with PyTorch
  - Includes training in `/Decision Transformer` and evaluation scripts in `/Evaluation` 
  - Pre-trained models available in `/Decision Transformer`
